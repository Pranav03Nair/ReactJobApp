### Overview

We already have our frontend, we need to make the backend. The backend needs to be modelled based on the mock server we used for frontend.

### Steps

1. Server.js (Standard Skeleton)

   - Setup `.env`
   - Setup Package imports and `PORT` and server `Listen`
   - Setup Middlewares
   - Setup Database
   - Setup Routes (Import and Access)

2. Database Setup (Connection and Schemas)

   - Configure MongoDb
   - JobModel

3. Job Route and Controllers (CRUD)

   - Route Controllers
   - Route

4. Axios Setup

   - Axios Instance

5. Axios Paths

## Issues

1.  ~~No Job Add error in case of incorrect phone number, Job not added either. But toast notif shows job added and redirects too~~
2.  ~~Job Page not working~~
